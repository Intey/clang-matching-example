# Soving compilation issues
Going through [this](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibASTMatchersTutorial.html)
tutorial, but try to compile with clang/ninja/llvm from ArchLinux repository
and provide CMakeLists.txt that support compilation with clang/gcc and building
with make/ninja.

Targets:
- [ ] Compile with GCC
- [ ] Compile with Clang
- [ ] Build with make
- [ ] Build with ninja
